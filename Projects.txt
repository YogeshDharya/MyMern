Material UI's custom theme helps in defining default themes for the buttons , textFields etc and can be used by keeping it as the parent of all as follows :
<ThemeProvider theme={createdTheme}><Child1 /><Child2 /><ThemeProvider />
//WHEN U GET STUCK
console.log("Not just before & after the error but also BROWSER'S console")

Read the entire bug again including the area right on top of from where the bug initiates PLUS 
the area from where the bug as such doesn't exist , these can be the two potential regions causing the bug to occur  
NEW check the files which are already imported within the current one THEY HAVE A PURPOSE 4 their existence  
look if that bug is even necessarry to resolve 
consider bugs as oppurtunities to learn something new  
QKart logo 
successful registeration msg 
Above if u want to ignore the proceeding warnings 
both at project directory 
then npm start first at the above directory and later at the backend dir
Should i keep my QCart logos as hyperLinks 2 ?
Technologies : DevOps 
Tools : Jenkins Tailwind CSS TypeScript 
OS : ?
DBMS CN ??
SEO ALSO should i keep my resume's extention in word format ?
cut short and linked in MCQs JS AND REACT
Stack OverFlow profiles 
alt for 
hooks used from notistack LIBRARY ?
QKart  
useHistory hook  helps in keeping a track of the previously visited urls  
B           U               G                   S

The url changed when i hit register but it didn't change the interface 
What should the back2Explore page and QKart logo should do 
How do i have dividers between Stack children 
How do i control the circular progress icon 
Register different from Login  ? 
does the control automatically go 2 the next textField 
How do i control the helper text below the TextField ?
I C a lot of meaningless space below the Register link , should i keep it in the center ? and increase its size ? or decrease the size of the parent   
Can we control the Color of this helperText  
how to toggle between split terminals   
Rest of the Qkart backend modules debriefs will be covered in some other sprint ? 
Had a question actually , can something be done to the scrolling while filling feedBack and querry forms ?

Unique :
Yogesh Made circular progress icon 
Register different from Login ? So different TextField different Stack direction style BUT 
Different color combinations color:secondary  

GK
Always look for defaults , The TextField component of material ui has outlined as default`
Default size is also the large
type: password 
UPDATES : accordian , carousal 

SECURITY
verified autherization by keeping app.use(validator) on top of other app.use(router) commands , thereby guarding the data at the first place itself , since 
access will b allowed only when the user api request has the required credentials||headers
IF ASKED 4 ISSUES / BUGS : yes i had seen that i couldn't access the body of the POST request url as sent from the front-end within my server's index.js  , because it was not in the 
json format , (was rather text ??!). ' . used another middleware which was express.json() --> app.use(express.json()) 
i was thinking of fetching those  records/documents from my MongoDB 's dataBase (MyDB's collection myTodos) whose startDate and endDate lied within the range specified by the user in the front-end 
which in turn will still be a GET request BUT it will require this data range to passed to the back-end so that i could be considered while fetching data from the DB
